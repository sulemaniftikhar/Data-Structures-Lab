# üåü **Data Structures Lab Assignments in C++**  

Welcome to the **Data Structures Lab Assignments** repository! This collection showcases my journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms**, implemented in **C++** as part of my **Spring 2024 coursework**.  

## üìÇ **Repository Structure**  
The repository is structured into 14 labs, each covering essential data structure concepts and practical implementations:  

| **Lab** | **Topic**                                                                                          |  
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Lab 1**  | Pointer, DMA, Arrays, and Linked Lists (OOP Revision)                                             |  
| **Lab 2**  | OOP Fundamentals: Classes, Objects, Pointers, Array-based Searching & Sorting, DMA, Time Analysis |  
| **Lab 3**  | Singly Linked Lists                                                                              |  
| **Lab 4**  | Doubly and Circular Linked Lists                                                                 |  
| **Lab 5**  | Stacks: Array & Linked List Implementations, Infix ‚Üî Prefix/Postfix                              |  
| **Lab 6**  | Advanced Stack Operations and Applications                                                      |  
| **Lab 7**  | Simple Queues, Circular Queues, and Queue Applications                                           |  
| **Lab 8**  | Circular Queues, Dequeues, and Priority Queues                                                   |  
| **Lab 9**  | Binary Search Trees: Insert, Traverse, Search, and Analyze                                       |  
| **Lab 10** | AVL Trees - Part I                                                                               |  
| **Lab 11** | AVL Trees - Part II                                                                              |  
| **Lab 12** | Binary Heaps: Min/Max Heap Implementation                                                        |  
| **Lab 13** | Graphs: BFS, DFS, Adjacency Structures, and Cycle Detection                                      |  
| **Lab 14** | Hashing                                                                                         |  

## ‚ú® **Highlights**  
- **Clean & Modular Code:** Each lab is implemented with readability and modularity in mind.  
- **Comprehensive Examples:** Includes test cases and edge-case handling.  
- **Optimization Focus:** Solutions emphasize efficiency and clarity.  

## üöÄ **How to Use**  
Clone the repository and explore the codebase:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/sulemaniftikhar/data-structures-labs.git  
cd data-structures-labs  
```  

Each lab folder contains:  
- **Source Code:** `.cpp` files with comments for clarity.  
- **ReadMe:** Description of concepts and implementation notes.  

## üìö **Learning Goals**  
This repository aims to deepen understanding of:  
1. Core data structures and their operations.  
2. Algorithm design and time complexity analysis.  
3. Real-world applications of data structures.
