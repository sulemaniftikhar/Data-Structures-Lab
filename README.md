# Data Structures Implementations in C++  

Welcome to the **Data Structures Lab Assignments** repository! This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures in C++, completed as part of my coursework during **Spring 2024**.  

## üìÅ Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into 14 lab folders, each focusing on different data structure concepts and their applications:  

1. **Lab 1:** Pointer, DMA, Arrays and Linked Lists (OOP Revision)
2. **Lab 2:** OOP, Classes, Objects, Pointers, Array for searching and sorting, DMA and Time Complexity Analysis
3. **Lab 3:** Singly Linked Lists 
4. **Lab 4:** Doubly and Circular Linked Lists
5. **Lab 5:** Stack, Stack (Linked list/Dynamic) and Infix Prefix Post Fix Notations
6. **Lab 6:** Stack Operations and Infix Prefix Post Fix Notations  
7. **Lab 7:** Implementation of Simple and Circular Both Queues and Application of Queue  
8. **Lab 8:** Implementation Circular Queues & Dequeue and Priority Queue 
9. **Lab 9:** Binary Search Trees, Recursive insert operation, Inorder and Postorder traversal, recursive Search operation and Tree Length and Count of Leaf nodes operations on BST 
10. **Lab 10:** AVL Tree I
11. **Lab 11:** AVL Tree II
12. **Lab 12:** Binary Heap and Max, Min Heap
13. **Lab 13:** Graphs, Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, BFS, DFS and Cycles detection 
14. **Lab 14:** Hashing 

## üöÄ Highlights  
- Implementations are written in clean, modular C++ code.  
- Focused on understanding core concepts and optimizing solutions.  
- Lab-specific examples and edge cases included.
